# Optimizing Hospitality: Forecasting Hotel Booking Fulfillment[

Scenario: What this project is about

Picture yourself as the manager of a bustling hotel, where each day brings a whirlwind of activityâ€”guests checking in, rooms being prepared, and reservations flooding in from around the world. Amidst this bustling environment, you're tasked with ensuring every reservation is seamlessly fulfilled, maximizing revenue while delivering exceptional guest experiences. However, with fluctuating demand and last-minute cancellations, staying ahead of the game can feel like navigating a maze blindfolded. That's where data science steps in, offering predictive modeling to illuminate the path forward.Accurately forecasting which reservations are likely to be fulfilled and which ones may be canceled enables hotels to optimize resource allocation and mitigate revenue loss associated with cancellations.

In this notebook, we will build some predictive models that can be used by hoteliers to predict if a booking will be fullfilled or not.
Techniques: Data Normalisation, Encoding, Balancing target variable using over sampling, GridSearchCV, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Extra Trees.
